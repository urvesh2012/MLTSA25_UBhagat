-What is the reason why you decided to take the class.
  Handling a time series data is crucial in every industry at this time. volume of the data is mejor concern, and i wanted to learn how will perform machine learning effectively with time series data.

-what do you hope to learn the most
  I'm mostly interested in neural networks with dataset like financial time series.

-what are the strength in your background or character that you think help you in the class?
  I have 3 years of experience with data engineering and analytics task, i know the complexity of handling high volume of time series data, so while learning ML for time series i can connect my experience with data and best part of me is i'm hardworking guy, if i'm not able to understand anything, i will strech my self and try to learn the things.
